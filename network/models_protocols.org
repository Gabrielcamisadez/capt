* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
*Header* ->
Located at the beginning of the TCP packet, the header is at least 20 bytes long and contains control information necessary for managing and controlling data transmission.

TCP establishes a reliable connection between two devices on a network, ensuring accurate and reliable data transmission. It detects and retransmits lost or corrupted data packets.

*SOurce port* -> Port number used by the client to initiate communication.

*Destination port* -> Port number used by the target computer.

*Sequence number* -> Ensures data is reassembled in the correct order.

*Acknowledgment Number* -> Confirms the receipt of data.

*Header length* -> Indicates the length of the header.

*Flags* -> Contains control signals for managing and terminating connections (e.g., SYN, ACK, FIN)

*Window Size* -> Indicates the amount of data that can be received without acknowledgment.

*checksum* -> Ensures data integrity.

*Urgent pointer* -> Indicates the presence of urgent data.

** Three-Way Handshake
The Three-Way Handshake establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a network using the TCP/IP protocol.

* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
 * One of the protocols used for data transfer by applications.
 * Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before sending data.
 * It does not guarantee the delivery of data.
 * Lacks flow control and retransmission of lost data.
 * Commonly used for audio and video transmission.

| Header | Description
| Source Port | Port number used by the client to initiate communication.
| Destination Port | Port number used by the target computer.
| Length | Defines the total number of bytes in the header and data.
| Checksum | Provides optional error-checking.

* Internet Protocol (IP):
- Identifies each device on the network by a unique IP address.
- The "ifconfig" command in a Linux system displays the assigned IP addresses.
