* intro
*system information* ->
- System Name: The system's name on the network. Important for associating an incident with a particular machine.
- Timezone: Critical for precisely determining the timing of events and synchronizing log entries across different systems.
- Network Configuration: Network settings such as IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers. These details help understand the system's network position and connections.
- Active Network Connections: Active network connections the system has at the moment. Important for identifying potential communication with attackers or data exfiltration by malware.
- Running Processes: List of programs actively running in memory and on the system. Helps identify malware or anomalous system behavior.
- DNS: DNS information used by the system, especially useful for understanding which domain names resolve to which IP addresses. This information can help detect connections to malicious domains.

*persistence mechanisms* ->

*Cron jobs* ->
List of commands and programs scheduled to run at specific times or intervals. Malware can use this mechanism to ensure regular execution.

*Services* ->
List of services set to run at system startup. Malware can register itself as a service to automatically execute every time the system starts.

*.bashrc* ->
A script executed by the shell (bash) at the start of user sessions. Malware can hide commands in this file to ensure execution or to trigger malicious behavior every time a session starts.

* execution traces
*sudo execution history* ->
Records of the sudo command used for high-privilege (root-like) operations. Helps determine if privileges have been misused.

*bash history* ->
List of commands executed in the Linux shell (bash). Useful for seeing user activities, file modifications, and other user actions.

*files accessed with VIM* ->
Vim can temporarily save changes to a file in swap files with a .swp extension. This can help recover the contents of deleted or edited files.

* log files
Perhaps the most importante artifact. Logs in Linux are easilly accessible and stored in a logically organized manner.

- Syslog: General logs produced by the Linux system and applications. Contains a wide range of information from security events to system errors.
- Authentication Logs: User authentication events such as login attempts (successful or failed) and authorization changes. Important for tracking account takeover attempts.
- Third-Party Logs: Log files generated by other applications running on the system, such as web servers (Apache, Nginx) and databases.
