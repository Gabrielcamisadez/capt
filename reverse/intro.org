* What is Reverse Engineering?
Reverse Engineering is an engineering process carried out to analyze a product, system, or program to understand its working mechanism, how and why it was made.

In the field of cybersecurity, Reverse Engineers work on software and systems. When code is compiled on computers, it is translated into machine code so that it can be understood by the computer.

Through the use of tools called disassemblers, machine code can be converted back into assembly language with a high degree of accuracy. Reverse engineers try to solve the application by analyzing the assembly code of the software.

*Malware Analysis* ->
This involves detecting the damage caused by malware to systems and gathering detailed information about which APT group created the malware.

*Vulnerability research* ->
This involves scanning systems and programs to identify security vulnerabilities and developing appropriate exploits to utilize these vulnerabilities.

*Cracking* ->
Known as license cracking, attackers manipulate license entries to obtain full versions of legal applications for free.

*Mobile application security* ->
Reverse engineers are also active in mobile platforms, focusing on malware analysis and application security. Through network and source code analysis, they can patch security vulnerabilities in mobile applications

*Firmware analysis and iot security* ->
Firmware refers to low-level software running on hardware components of devices. This

* Basic Assembly
Assembly language is the closest programming language to machine language. The machine code of compiled applications can be converted into assembly code by a disassembler.

The stack and heap are logical sections of memory. The stack operates on a LIFO (Last In First Out)
principle. We can think of the stack as a place where data is stored in a stacked manner.

The Stack stores value types such as int, short, byte, long, decimal, double, float, as well as pointers and addresses, whereas the Heap stores reference types.

*Registers* ->
Registers are structures located in the CPU core that hold data for the calculations the processor will perform and allow quick access to them when needed.

*intel x86 architecture* ->
In reverse engineering, the most commonly used registers are as follows
