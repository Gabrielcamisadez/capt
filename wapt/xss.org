* reflected xss
Reflected XSS is a type of attack where a malicious script is sent to a web application and reflected back to the user's browser.

 These attacks usually occur when users are tricked by social engineering tactics into clicking on a link containing the XSS payload.These links trigger an HTTP request containing malicious code, which the server mirrors back in the HTTP response, executing within the user's browser.

 An attacker can craft a URL containing a malicious script that gets reflected by the web application:

 : https://example.com/home?search=<script>alert('XSS')</script>

 A simple XSS payload was entered into the search box to trigger a JavaScript alert displaying the number "1". The payload successfully executed, confirming the vulnerability.

 : ?q=<script>alert(1)</script>

 *html injection* ->
 : ?q=<h1 style="color:green;">TEST</h1>

*vulnerable php code* ->
 #+begin_src php
<?php
    if (isset($_GET['q'])) {
        $q = $_GET['q'];
        echo '<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
            No Result Found for <b>' . $q . '</b>
        </div>';
    }
?>
 #+end_src

 This code checks for the presence of a q GET parameter in the URL. If the parameter is present, its value is assigned to the variable $q.

 This variable is then directly echoed into an HTML context within <div> and <b> tags.

* stored xss
Stored XSS is a type of attack where malicious scripts are stored in a web application's database and then executed in the user's browser whenever the affected page is viewed.

 These attacks usually occur in scenarios where user-provided data is stored, such as messaging apps, forum posts, comments, or user profiles.

The key difference from Reflected XSS is that the payload is stored in the database.

*vulnerable code* ->
 #+begin_src php
<?php
    $messages = $db->query("SELECT * FROM messages");
    if ($messages) {
        while ($row = $messages->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
            echo "<div>" . $row['message'] . "</div>";
        }
    }
?>
 #+end_src

This PHP code snippet fetches messages from the database and directly displays them in an HTML context.This creates an environment susceptible to Stored XSS attacks.

* DOM-basesd XSS
DOM-based XSS is a type of attack that occurs when a web page's client-side scripts (JavaScript) manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in an unsafe way.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure, style, and content of a web document

It is a standard for HTML and XML documents and enables dynamic updates to web pages.

The DOM is commonly used with JavaScript. JavaScript uses DOM APIs to dynamically change the structure, style, and content of a web page.

DOM-based XSS involves the manipulation of the DOM by client-side scripts. These vulnerabilities occur not during the initial page load from the server, but during the execution of client-side scripts.

*source code* ->
#+begin_src javascript
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = window.location.hash.substring(1);
#+end_src

*payload* ->
#+begin_src text
https://example.com#<script>alert(1)</script>
#+end_src

In this example, the fragment part of the URL (#<script>alert(1)</script>) is assigned directly to the innerHTML property of an HTML element, causing the browser to execute the JavaScript.

** eval function to execute XSS
*source code* ->
#+begin_src javascript
window.onload = function() {
    const productId = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('id');
    eval('getProduct('+ productId.toString()+')');
}
#+end_src

*payload* ->
: https://example.com/products?id=');alert(1)//

The above code takes the id parameter from the URL and uses the eval() function to call getProduct().

In this payload, the id parameter ends with a closing parenthesis ('), followed by );, ending the current eval() call.

** innerHTML function to execute XSS
*source code* ->
#+begin_src javascript
document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = unescape(location.search.substring(1));
#+end_src

*payload* ->
: https://example.com?%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

In this scenario, user input (location.search) is directly assigned to innerHTML, which can execute any hazardous scripts if the input contains malicious code.

* DOM-base XSS Attack

[[./imgs/calc.png]]

It appears to be an application that calculates the area of a triangle based on height and base values. To understand its working principle, values are entered and tested.
: https://example.com/?height=5&base=12

*Affected COde* ->
#+begin_src php
<script>
  var height = 5;
  var base = 12;
  var ans = base * height / 2;
  document.getElementById("answer").innerHTML = "<b>Area:</b> " + ans;
</script>
#+end_src

 it is seen that values assigned to variables height and base are included in the JavaScript within the HTML. This appears to be an exploitable point.

 A payload triggering an alert box displaying the number 1 is entered into the height field.
 : https://example.com/?height=5; alert(1)&base=12

*Affected Code* ->
#+begin_src javascript
<script>
  var height = 5;alert(1);
  var base = 12;
  var ans = base * height / 2;
  document.getElementById("answer").innerHTML = "<b>Area:</b> " + ans;
</script>
#+end_src


*vulnerable code* ->
#+begin_src javascript
<?php
    if (isset($_GET['base']) && isset($_GET['height'])) {
        echo '<div class="alert alert-success" id="answer"></div>';
        echo '<script>';
        echo 'var height = ' . $_GET['height'] . ';';
        echo 'var base = ' . $_GET['base'] . ';';
        echo 'var ans = base * height / 2;';
        echo 'document.getElementById("answer").innerHTML = "<b>Area:</b> " + ans;';
        echo '</script>';
    }
?>
#+end_src

This code snippet directly includes user-provided base and height values into JavaScript code. If these parameters contain malicious content, they can be executed in the browser, causing an XSS attack.

* Blind XSS
Blind XSS is a type of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack that occurs when a web application processes and stores user input but does not reflect it immediately on the visible/frontend of the application.

In a Blind XSS attack, an attacker provides input containing an XSS payload to the application.

An attacker can utilize the User-Agent header to inject malicious code. If the application logs this header directly and displays it in a web interface, the attack may succeed.

: User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 <script>alert('XSS')</script>

The Referer HTTP header indicates the URL of the resource from which the request was initiated.

Attackers can inject JavaScript code into this header, which can be executed if viewed by the admin panel without proper sanitization.

: Referer: http://other-site.com<script>alert('XSS')</script>

The X-Forwarded-For header specifies the original IP address from which a request was made.

: X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.15 <script>alert('XSS');</script>
