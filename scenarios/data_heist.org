#+title: Data Heist
#+author: gabriel

* intro
We have noticed that there are some employees in our company who are not sufficiently aware of cybersecurity issues. It has been observed that these employees have uploaded files containing company data to a website called "Exif Viewer" in order to view metadata information.

The site claims that it does not store the uploaded files. However, we have to make sure that this is the case. If any of our company's files have been compromised in this process, we need to determine what information may be at risk. You are expected to guide us through this critical process. We rely on your expertise.

Good luck!
