An exciting mission awaits you!

We have received a security notification from one of the companies we provide services for that there has been a phishing attack against the company. We only have the phishing email sent by the attackers. We need to identify who the attackers are and which employees' information was stolen.

We are looking for your help in conducting this investigation. We trust you to complete the task in the best way possible!

Good luck!
