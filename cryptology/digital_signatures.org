A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to verify the identity of the sender of a document or message and to ensure that the content has not been altered.

Digital signatures use asymmetric encryption algorithms to provide security for electronic documents and communication.

* purpose of digital signatures
*Authentication* -> To verify the identity of the person signing the document.

*Integrity* -> To ensure that the document has not been altered after being signed.

*Non-repudiation* -> To prevent the person who signed the document from denying that they signed it.

* creating a digital signature
*Hashing the document* -> The hash value of the document to be signed is calculated using a secure hash function.

*Encrypting the hash* -> The calculated hash value is encrypted using the sender's private key. This encrypted hash value becomes the digital signature.

*Appending the Digital signature* -> The digital signature is appended to the document or sent along with it.

* verifying a digital signature
*Hashing the document* -> The recipient recalculates the hash value of the document using the same hash function.

*Decrypting the Digital Signature* -> The recipient decrypts the digital signature using the sender's public key and compares the obtained hash value

*Comparison* -> If the two hash values match, the document's integrity is confirmed, and the sender's identity is verified.

* algorithms

1. *RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)*
- Used for both encryption and digital signature processes.
- A reliable algorithm for creating and verifying signatures.

2. *DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)*
- Standardized by NIST in 1991 for digital signatures.
- Used only for creating and verifying digital signatures.
- Faster signature creation but slower verification compared to RSA.

3. *ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)*
- Based on elliptic curve cryptography.
- Provides high security with shorter key lengths.
- Widely use
