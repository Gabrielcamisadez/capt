Hex encoding is a transfer encoding in which each byte is converted to the 2-digit base-16 encoding of that byte (preserving leading zeroes), which is then usually encoded in ASCII.

It is inefficient, but it is a simple, commonly-used way to represent binary data in plain text.

What is the decoded message of the text that has been encoded using Hex Encoding inside the file?
