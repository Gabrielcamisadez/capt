Quoted-printable is an encoding method defined in the MIME standard. It is used primarily to encode 8-bit text (such as text that includes foreign characters) into 7-bit US ASCII, creating a document that is mostly readable by humans

All MIME-compliant applications can decode quoted-printable text, though they may not necessarily be able to properly display the document as it was originally intended.
