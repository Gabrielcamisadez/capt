1 Cryptography
══════════════

  Cryptography is the science of using mathematical methods and
  algorithms to transmit and store information securely. The primary
  goals of cryptography are ->

  ‣ *Confidentiality*-> Ensuring that information is readable only by
     authorized individuals.
  ‣ *Integrity*-> Protecting information against unauthorized
     alterations.
  ‣ *Authentication*-> Verifying the origin of the information.
  ‣ *Non-repudiation*-> Ensuring that the sender cannot deny having sent
     the information.


2 types
═══════

  *symmetric cryptography* -> The same key is used for both encryption
   and decryption processes.

  *asymmetric cryptography* -> Different but mathematically related keys
   (public key and private key) are used for encryption and decryption
   processes.


3 Cryptanalysis
═══════════════

  Cryptanalysis comprises methods used to uncover weaknesses in
  cryptographic systems and break them.

  Cryptanalysis techniques are used to evaluate the security of
  cryptographic systems and identify vulnerabilities.

  *breaking attacks* -> Attacks aimed at obtaining the ciphertext or the
   key to decrypt the information.

  *analysis attack* -> Attacks that investigate the weaknesses of the
   encryption algorithm or protocol.


4 some famous principles
════════════════════════

  *kerckhoffs’s principle* -> The security of a cryptosystem should
   depend on the secrecy of the key, not the algorithm.

  *shannon’s theory* -> The ciphertext should not contain meaningful
   statistical structures and should appear random.


5 cryptanalysis techniques
══════════════════════════

  *brute force attacks* -> these attacks aim to find the correct key by
   trying commonly used words and passwords

  *side channel attacks* -> these attacks use auxiliary information,
   such as the time taken or the energy consumed by the encryption
   device to decrypt information

  *statistical Attacks* -> These attacks aim to decrypt information by
   exploiting statistical properties of the ciphertext
